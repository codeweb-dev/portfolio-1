# What to Learn First as a Beginner Programmer

One of the hardest parts of learning programming isn’t the code —  
it’s deciding **what to learn and what to ignore**.

There are endless tutorials, tools, and opinions. If you try to learn everything at once, you’ll burn out before anything sticks.

This post gives you a **simple learning order** that works across *any* programming language.

## Step 1: Learn How Programs Run

Before syntax, frameworks, or tools, understand this:

> A program runs **top to bottom**, one instruction at a time.

Focus on:
- How files are executed
- How code flows
- What happens when an error occurs

Once you understand *execution flow*, debugging becomes less scary.

## Step 2: Master the Core Building Blocks

Every language shares the same fundamentals. Learn these first:

- Variables (storing values)
- Conditions (`if / else`)
- Loops (repeat work)
- Functions (reuse logic)
- Basic data structures (arrays, objects)

Example (JavaScript):

```js
function isAdult(age) {
  if (age >= 18) {
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}

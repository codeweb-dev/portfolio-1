# My Story

For a long time, I didn’t know who I wanted to be.

I wasn’t the kind of kid with a clear dream or a strong direction.  
I went to school, finished my tasks, and moved forward — not because I knew where I was going, but because life kept pushing me ahead.

Most days, I was just surviving.

---

## Growing Up Without a Clear Dream

When I was young, people would ask me:

> *“What do you want to be when you grow up?”*

I never had a confident answer.

No engineer.  
No doctor.  
No architect.

Just silence.

I didn’t feel special.  
I didn’t feel talented.  
I felt like someone trying to keep up with the world around me.

---

## When Something Finally Changed

Everything began to shift when I reached **Senior High School**.

For the first time, I felt something different.

I started to enjoy studying.

Not because I had to — but because I wanted to understand.

Little by little, I became more focused.  
I managed my time better.  
I began to believe that maybe I wasn’t incapable after all.

When I graduated, I earned **honors**.

That moment stayed with me.

Not because of the recognition —  
but because it proved something important:

> *I wasn’t behind. I was just getting started.*

---

## Dreams Meet Reality

At that time, I dreamed of becoming an **architect**.

I imagined designing buildings.  
Creating something meaningful.  
Leaving something behind.

But dreams don’t exist alone.

Reality arrived quietly — and painfully.

My family was struggling financially.  
Tuition fees were heavy.  
Daily needs were already difficult.

College felt impossible.

---

## A Door I Didn’t Expect

Then God opened a door.

I learned about **EARIST Cavite Campus** — a public college with **no tuition fees**.

It felt like hope.

I searched for Architecture.

It wasn’t there.

Instead, I saw **Computer Science**.

The name sounded intimidating.  
But it also sounded powerful.  
Something about it felt… right.

---

## Choosing Without Certainty

I spent weeks deciding between **IT** and **Computer Science**.

I watched videos.  
I read comparisons.  
I asked myself what path could truly change my life.

The differences were small, but the decision felt big.

In the end, I chose **Computer Science**.

Not because I knew everything about it —  
but because I believed it would push me forward.

---

## Learning With Almost Nothing

During my Senior High School OJT and semestral break, I started learning on my own.

I watched tutorials.  
I read articles.  
I explored technology.

There was just one problem.

I didn’t have a laptop.

So I coded on my **phone**.

Sometimes, I even used our **low-spec TV**.

I searched for the lightest editors I could find — anything that would allow me to practice.

When I learned **HTML** and saw my own information appear on a web page for the first time, I was amazed.

It felt unreal.

---

## Long Days, Simple Breaks

From **8 AM to 10 PM**, I studied.

Every day.

My only breaks were eating and sleeping.

No one forced me.  
No one reminded me.

I wanted this more than anything.

---

## Coding While Plugged In

Before college began, my father managed to buy me a **low-spec laptop**.

It wasn’t powerful.  
It wasn’t fast.

If I unplugged it — it shut down immediately.

So I coded while charging.

Always.

That laptop overheated, lagged, and struggled.

But it carried my dreams.

---

## The First Breakthrough

In **December 2024**, during my **second year in college**, something happened.

I received my **first commission**.

Someone trusted my skills.  
Someone believed I could deliver.

That moment meant everything to me.

Not because of the money —  
but because it was proof:

> *I was becoming real.*

---

## Momentum

A month later, another client came.

Then someone recommended me.

Then another project followed.

After **three months of commissions**, I finally bought a **mid-range laptop**.

For the first time, I felt free.

For the first time, I felt unstoppable.

---

## Building for the Real World

Between **September and November 2025**, I reached a turning point.

I built **fully functional systems** for companies and businesses.

Production-ready.  
Built from scratch.  
Designed to solve real problems.

This wasn’t practice anymore.

This was responsibility.

And I was ready for it.

---

## Where I Stand Now

Today, I am a **3rd year Computer Science student**.

I’m preparing for my **thesis**.

I can now help support my family financially.

And for the first time in my life, I know where I’m heading.

---

## For Anyone Reading This

If you’re struggling…

If you feel lost…

If you think you’re behind…

I want you to remember this:

> You don’t need a perfect start.  
> You just need to keep going.

I started with:
- No clear dream  
- No money  
- No laptop  

What I had was **faith**, **curiosity**, and **persistence**.

And that was enough.

---

## This Is Not the End

This story isn’t about success.

It’s about patience.  
Sacrifice.  
And believing that tomorrow can be better than today.

This is my story.

And I’m still writing it. 🚀

**Sincerely yours**
